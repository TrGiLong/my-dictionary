# MyDictionary

This application allows users to create their own dictionary. The app was created in 2014 and was my first personal project. I used Objective-C with procedure style programming to create it. The most UI elements were created in xib files. I used this project to take  part in the school competition and later in regional competition.

Features:
- Add, edit and remove word
- Search words
- Small exercise for training.
